# WSL Support Notes

This note tracks the WSL path for `rocm-cli` with TheRock-managed Python
virtual environments and ROCDXG (`librocdxg`).

## Current Host Finding

On this machine, the installed Ubuntu distro is WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04.4. It has:

- `/dev/dxg`
- `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/libdxcore.so`
- Windows SDK headers visible under `/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.26100.0`
- `/opt/rocm/lib/librocdxg.so` from `rocdxg-roct 1.2.0`
- `librocdxg.so` visible through `ldconfig -p`
- Rust/Cargo inside WSL
- a rocm-cli-managed TheRock runtime

`/opt/rocm/share/rocdxg/dids.conf` is not present because the current
`rocdxg-roct 1.2.0` package does not ship it; the preflight treats this as
optional. `rocminfo` is also not on the global PATH, but `rocminfo` from the
managed TheRock runtime works when launched with the managed TheRock SDK
library path plus `/opt/rocm/lib` and `/usr/lib/wsl/lib`.

## Prerequisites

The AMD WSL path is:

1. Windows 11 with the AMD Adrenalin WSL-capable driver.
2. WSL2 with Ubuntu 24.04 or Ubuntu 22.04.
3. ROCDXG (`librocdxg`) installed inside WSL.
4. A TheRock runtime installed by `rocm-cli` into a managed Python venv.

Useful read-only preflight:

```bash
python scripts/wsl_preflight.py
python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --json
python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --require-ready
```

From Windows PowerShell, target a specific distro:

```powershell
python scripts\wsl_preflight.py --distro Ubuntu
```

## Install ROCDXG In WSL

Install build/runtime prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl git cmake build-essential python3 python3-venv
```

Preferred package install for the current public release:

```bash
curl -L -o /tmp/rocdxg-roct_1.2.0_amd64.deb \
  https://github.com/ROCm/librocdxg/releases/download/v1.2.0/rocdxg-roct_1.2.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt install -y /tmp/rocdxg-roct_1.2.0_amd64.deb
sudo ldconfig
```

From this repo inside WSL, the same supported path is wrapped as:

```bash
bash scripts/wsl_setup_rocdxg.sh
python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --require-ready
```

To require checksum verification before installing the downloaded `.deb`, set
`ROCDXG_SHA256` to the trusted 64-character SHA-256 digest for that exact
ROCDXG package:

```bash
ROCDXG_SHA256=<64-hex-sha256> bash scripts/wsl_setup_rocdxg.sh
```

The wrapper intentionally does not guess or embed a production checksum. If
`ROCDXG_SHA256` is set and the downloaded package does not match, installation
stops before `apt install`.

Source-build alternative:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/librocdxg.git
cd librocdxg
export win_sdk="/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.26100.0"
if [ -f "${win_sdk}/shared/dxcore_interface.h" ]; then
  win_sdk_include="${win_sdk}/shared"
elif [ -f "${win_sdk}/um/dxcore_interface.h" ]; then
  win_sdk_include="${win_sdk}/um"
else
  echo "DXCore headers were not found under ${win_sdk}" >&2
  exit 1
fi
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DWIN_SDK="${win_sdk_include}"
make -j"$(nproc)"
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

For legacy ROCm releases, set:

```bash
export HSA_ENABLE_DXG_DETECTION=1
```

ROCK/TheRock 7.13 and newer should not require that variable, but setting it is
still useful for compatibility checks while the WSL path is being hardened.

## TheRock Runtime Env In WSL

`rocm-cli` should continue to own the Python venv. Do not rely on an externally
created venv such as `D:\jam\venv`.

The WSL activation environment for HIP applications that do not preload ROCm
the way PyTorch does must include the managed TheRock runtime package paths and
WSL DXCore path. With the managed `rocm[libraries,devel]` install, these paths
come from the rocm-cli runtime manifest, `rocm-sdk path --root`, and
`rocm_sdk.find_libraries(...)`.

```bash
export ROCM_ROOT="<managed _rocm_sdk_core or devel root from the runtime manifest>"
export ROCM_PATH="${ROCM_ROOT}"
export ROCM_HOME="${ROCM_ROOT}"
export HIP_PATH="${ROCM_ROOT}"
export PATH="<managed TheRock bin dirs>:${PATH}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<managed TheRock library dirs>:/usr/lib/wsl/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}"
```

For `rocm-cli`, the command itself should resolve the managed runtime manifest
and apply that environment before launching non-PyTorch HIP apps such as
`llama.cpp`. Users should not have to hand-export these values.

## Doctor And Install UX Recommendations

`rocm doctor` should detect WSL cheaply and report:

- `wsl: true`
- WSL distro/version
- `/dev/dxg` presence
- `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/libdxcore.so` presence
- `/opt/rocm/lib/librocdxg.so` presence
- `librocdxg` linker-cache visibility from `ldconfig -p`
- `rocminfo` from the active TheRock runtime after activation
- whether `HSA_ENABLE_DXG_DETECTION` is needed or set
- managed TheRock runtime count and active/default runtime

`rocm install sdk` inside WSL should:

- default to a managed pip venv, same as native Linux and Windows
- avoid installing global WSL packages unless the user explicitly approves
- fail clearly when WSL GPU prerequisites are absent
- after install, validate `python -m rocm_sdk version`,
  `python -m rocm_sdk targets`, runtime library discovery through
  `rocm_sdk.find_libraries`, and at least one HIP-visible GPU probe when
  ROCDXG is ready

`rocm setup` in WSL should offer a staged plan:

1. Verify WSL/DXCore.
2. Explain missing ROCDXG if absent.
3. Ask before any `sudo apt install` or `sudo make install`.
4. Install TheRock into a managed venv.
5. Install/build HIP `llama.cpp`.
6. Run a tiny GGUF GPU smoke test with CPU fallback disabled.

## Non-Destructive Tests

Safe tests that do not mutate global WSL state:

- `python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --self-test`
- `python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --json`
- `python scripts/wsl_preflight.py --require-ready` on a prepared WSL machine
- `rocm install sdk --channel release --format pip --dry-run` inside WSL with
  isolated `ROCM_CLI_*` directories

Gated tests that require explicit opt-in because they may download packages or
need `sudo`:

- install ROCDXG `.deb`
- build ROCDXG from source
- install TheRock wheels into a fresh managed WSL venv
- build HIP `llama.cpp`
- run tiny GGUF inference on GPU
