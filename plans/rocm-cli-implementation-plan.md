# rocm-cli Implementation Plan

## Summary
- Build `rocm-cli` as a TheRock-only local AI control plane for AMD systems. It should install and manage TheRock runtimes on Linux and Windows, optionally install Linux DKMS drivers through official AMD flows, run local model servers, and provide a chat-first terminal experience for ROCm/TheRock operations.
- Make `rocm` default to an interactive TUI on a real TTY. The TUI should feel like a Codex-style interface: transcript, visible plans, tool execution, approvals, logs, and local state in one screen.
- Keep TheRock as the only managed runtime stream:
  - `release`: latest stable TheRock release
  - `nightly`: latest nightly for the selected platform and GPU family
- Default managed runtime installs to a user-owned `pip` virtual environment backed by TheRock wheels. Keep tarball installs as an explicit alternative, especially for system prefixes such as `/opt/rocm`.
- On Windows, constrain V1 runtime management to `pip` venv installs and existing-driver validation. Use TheRock PyTorch wheels plus a managed `pytorch` serving engine as the default native Windows local serving path.
- Use pluggable serving engines instead of hard-coding one runtime. V1 should support `pytorch`, `llama.cpp`, `vllm`, `sglang`, and `atom` through a common plugin contract.
- Use pluggable chat providers:
  - `local`: talk to a locally served model
  - `anthropic`: use Anthropic API when configured
  - `openai`: use OpenAI API when configured
- Implement contained automations and watchers natively inside `rocm-cli`. Take inspiration from OpenClaw's event and hook patterns, but do not depend on OpenClaw itself.

## Product Goals
- Provide a one-line bootstrap install such as `curl -fsSL ... | sh` that installs a signed `rocm` launcher into `~/.local/bin/`.
- Work on Linux and Windows systems with an AMD GPU and on CPU-only systems.
- Work with an existing TheRock installation or install a self-contained TheRock runtime under a user-owned prefix.
- Detect updates every time `rocm` runs and offer to update the CLI, TheRock runtime, engines, or model recipes.
- Translate natural language requests into structured plans and explicit tool executions.
- Make local model serving easy:
  - `serve Qwen3.5 with vllm`
  - `run a small local model on cpu`
  - `install the latest TheRock nightly for this GPU`
- Keep privileged operations explicit and auditable.

## Non-Goals
- `rocm-cli` is not a replacement for TheRock build-from-source workflows.
- `rocm-cli` is not a generic autonomous agent platform with arbitrary shell access.
- `rocm-cli` should not manage legacy ROCm release streams from `repo.radeon.com`.
- `rocm-cli` should not promise that every model can run on every host. Model fit must be resolved against CPU, VRAM, RAM, engine support, and artifact availability.

## Key Product Decisions
- TheRock-only:
  - Manage only TheRock `release` and `nightly` channels.
  - Legacy ROCm installs may be detected for diagnostics, but they are out of management scope.
- Runtime packaging:
  - Default to `pip` venv installs under a user-owned prefix.
  - Support tarball installs as an explicit alternative.
  - Prefer tarballs for system-style prefixes such as `/opt/rocm`.
- Chat-first:
  - `rocm` with no subcommand launches the TUI.
  - Scriptable subcommands remain for automation and CI.
- Local-first:
  - The default experience should work without any cloud API key.
  - Cloud providers are optional adapters, not the core product.
- Plugins over hard-coded engines:
  - Serving engines are process plugins discovered at runtime.
  - Provider integrations are adapters behind a common chat/runtime interface.
- Native automation subsystem:
  - Implement watchers, policies, sandboxing, and audit logs inside `rocm-cli`.
  - Do not make OpenClaw a required dependency.

## User Experience

### Startup Behavior
- Interactive TTY:
  - `rocm` launches the full-screen TUI.
- Non-interactive shell or explicit subcommand:
  - `rocm doctor`
  - `rocm install sdk --channel release`
  - `rocm serve qwen3.5 --engine vllm`
- On startup, `rocm` should:
  - load local config and session state
  - perform a bounded update check using cached manifests and ETags
  - detect host capabilities
  - attach to or start the local supervisor if needed
- `rocmd` lifecycle:
  - default to on-demand startup for foreground CLI and TUI operations
  - remain long-lived only when automations, watchers, or managed background services are enabled

### TUI Goals
- Give the user a single interface for:
  - chat and planning
  - install and update flows
  - serving lifecycle
  - logs and health status
  - watcher events and queued proposals
- Show what the system is doing instead of hiding it behind a spinner.

### TUI Interaction Model
- The TUI should be tool-aware, not just conversational.
- Every actionable request becomes:
  1. intent parse
  2. structured plan
  3. approval decision if needed
  4. visible tool execution
  5. summarized result
- The transcript should show:
  - plan cards
  - tool call cards
  - streaming logs
  - final outcomes
  - links to artifacts such as config diffs, logs, or generated manifests

### TUI Modes
- `Ask`
  - explain state, compare engines, recommend models, answer ROCm/TheRock questions
- `Act`
  - run installs, updates, pulls, and serving actions
- `Serve`
  - focus on engine, model, endpoint, and request tests
- `Logs`
  - tail engine logs, install logs, and watcher output
- `Automations`
  - inspect events, policies, queued proposals, and audit history

### TUI Commands and Shortcuts
- Slash commands:
  - `/doctor`
  - `/install sdk`
  - `/install driver`
  - `/update`
  - `/engine`
  - `/provider`
  - `/model`
  - `/logs`
  - `/automations`
  - `/plan`
- Keyboard model:
  - `Enter`: send or approve focused action
  - `Esc`: cancel focused modal or proposal
  - `Tab`: cycle panes
  - `Ctrl+L`: clear transient output
  - `Ctrl+R`: refresh status
  - `?`: open shortcuts help

### Approval Model
- No approval needed for:
  - read-only inspection
  - local health checks
  - dry-run planning
  - log viewing
- Explicit approval required for:
  - installing or upgrading TheRock runtime
  - installing Linux DKMS drivers
  - any future Windows driver management actions
  - switching `release` and `nightly`
  - binding public network ports
  - deleting caches or models
  - sending prompts to cloud providers when not already enabled

## CLI Surface

### Primary Commands
- `rocm`
- `rocm doctor`
- `rocm install sdk --channel release|nightly [--format pip|tarball] [--prefix PATH]`
- `rocm install driver --dkms`
- `rocm update`
- `rocm engines list`
- `rocm engines install <engine>`
- `rocm serve <model>`
- `rocm chat --provider local|anthropic|openai`
- `rocm automations list`
- `rocm automations enable <watcher>`
- `rocm logs`

### Natural Language Entry
- Input text should be accepted in both TUI and non-interactive form:
  - `rocm "serve qwen3.5 with vllm"`
  - `rocm "install the latest TheRock nightly for this GPU"`
  - `rocm "run a small local model on cpu"`
- The planner should compile this into structured actions before execution.

## Architecture

### High-Level Components
- `rocm`
  - main CLI and TUI binary
  - request parsing
  - planning
  - approvals
  - local command execution
- `rocmd`
  - optional local supervisor
  - manages long-lived services, watcher execution, and background update checks
  - exposes a local Unix socket or named pipe API to the CLI
  - runs persistently only when background features are enabled; otherwise it may be started on demand and exited when idle
- metadata/index layer
  - release manifests
  - model recipes
  - engine compatibility data
  - provider defaults
- plugin runner
  - launches serving engine plugins in separate processes
  - handles health checks and lifecycle
- sandbox runner
  - executes watcher jobs in a contained environment with structured tools only

### Implementation Language
- Use Rust for the launcher, TUI, supervisor, plugin runtime, and sandbox policy engine.
- Use `ratatui` and `crossterm` for the TUI.
- Prefer subprocess-based plugin protocols over in-process dynamic libraries to avoid ABI problems.

### State Layout

~/.local/bin/
  rocm
```

### Metadata Model
- TheRock release metadata should remain the source of truth for TheRock artifacts.
- `rocm-cli` should add its own signed metadata index for:
  - engine plugin versions and install rules
  - model aliases and recipes
  - hardware fit heuristics
  - default channel and policy settings
- This lets `rocm-cli` evolve without changing TheRock release assets for every product rule.

### Update Model
- Every `rocm` invocation should perform a quick manifest freshness check.
- Checks should be:
  - bounded by a short timeout
  - cached
  - tolerant of offline use
- Updates should be reported separately for:
  - `rocm-cli`
  - managed TheRock runtime
  - engine plugins
  - model recipes
- Updates should be offered on every run, but not auto-applied by default.

## Install and Runtime Management

### Bootstrap Install
- The one-line installer should:
  - detect host OS and architecture
  - download a signed `rocm` launcher
  - place it in `~/.local/bin/`
  - write a minimal config file if none exists
  - verify checksum or signature before activation
- The bootstrap should not install drivers or large runtimes by default.

### Host Detection
- `rocm doctor` should detect:
  - OS, kernel, distro, architecture
  - CPU features
  - AMD GPU presence and GPU family
  - existing TheRock runtime
  - legacy ROCm installs for compatibility reporting
  - existing engines
  - model cache state
  - permissions required for driver work

### TheRock Runtime Install
- Install modes:
  - adopt existing TheRock runtime
  - install a managed `pip` virtual environment under `~/.local/share/rocm-cli/runtimes/`
  - install a managed tarball under a user-selected prefix such as `/opt/rocm`
  - switch between managed `release` and `nightly` installs
- Default behavior:
  - use a `pip` venv install for user-scoped managed runtimes
  - keep runtime activation and Python package state isolated per installed version
  - use tarball installs only when explicitly requested or when targeting a system-style prefix
- The runtime manager should:
  - resolve the correct artifact by OS, architecture, and GPU family
  - prefer TheRock wheel sets for user-managed installs
  - support tarball installs for system-style layouts and non-venv deployment targets
  - maintain side-by-side versions for rollback
  - update symlinks for the active runtime atomically
- Windows V1 constraints:
  - support managed `pip` venv installs only
  - do not support tarball-based system installs in early phases
  - assume the system AMD driver is already installed
  - focus on TheRock ROCm and PyTorch wheel flows

### Driver Management
- Linux only.
- Driver installation should wrap official AMD install flows instead of reimplementing them.
- Responsibilities:
  - validate distro and kernel support
  - validate root or `sudo` availability
  - explain reboot requirements
  - execute the official DKMS install path
  - record driver state and last-known version
- Non-goals:
  - custom DKMS packaging logic
  - silent kernel changes
- Windows:
  - assume an AMD driver is already installed
  - detect and report driver presence and compatibility in `doctor`
  - defer any Windows driver installation or upgrade flow to a later phase

### Existing Installations
- If an existing TheRock runtime is found, `rocm-cli` should allow:
  - adopt as external runtime
  - import into managed state
  - leave unmanaged and use read-only
- If only a legacy ROCm runtime is found, `rocm-cli` should:
  - report it in `doctor`
  - warn that management and upgrades are out of scope
  - still allow CPU-only or provider-backed chat flows

## Serving and Chat Backend Architecture

### Engine Plugin Contract
- Every serving engine plugin should be a separate executable discovered from a plugin directory.
- Plugin protocol should be JSON-RPC over stdio or a local socket.
- Required plugin methods:
  - `detect`
  - `install`
  - `capabilities`
  - `resolve_model`
  - `launch`
  - `healthcheck`
  - `endpoint`
  - `stop`
  - `logs`
- Reported capabilities should include:
  - `cpu`
  - `rocm_gpu`
  - `multi_gpu`
  - `openai_compatible`
  - `tool_calling`
  - `quantized_models`
  - `distributed_serving`
  - `reasoning_parser`

### Built-In Engine Priorities
- `pytorch`
  - default Windows local serving engine
  - built on TheRock PyTorch wheels with a `rocm-cli` managed serving wrapper
  - should expose the same normalized endpoint contract as the other engines
- `llama.cpp`
  - baseline CPU fallback
  - good for quantized local models
- `vllm`
  - default ROCm GPU serving path
- `sglang`
  - reasoning- and router-friendly engine option
- `atom`
  - AMD-optimized path for select hardware and recipes
  - treat as experimental until packaging and compatibility mature
- Windows engine policy:
  - default to a managed `pytorch` serving engine backed by TheRock PyTorch wheels
  - keep `llama.cpp` available as a fallback for quantized or explicit CPU-oriented workflows
  - use GPU execution through TheRock PyTorch on supported Windows systems when a usable AMD driver is present
  - do not make `vllm`, `sglang`, or `atom` native Windows GPU serving part of the V1 promise

### PyTorch Serving Engine
- The `pytorch` engine should be a first-party `rocm-cli` plugin, not a dependency on TorchServe.
- Detailed spec: `plans/rocm-cli-pytorch-engine-spec.md`
- Responsibilities:
  - create and manage a TheRock PyTorch virtual environment
  - install compatible model-serving dependencies such as `transformers`, tokenizers, and runtime helpers
  - serve selected models through the same local API contract used by the other engines
  - prefer GPU execution on Windows when a supported AMD driver and TheRock PyTorch wheel set are present
  - fall back to CPU execution when no usable GPU path is available
- Initial scope:
  - single-model local serving
  - chat and text-generation workloads
  - streaming responses
  - OpenAI-compatible local endpoint surface where practical
  - straightforward batching, not high-throughput distributed scheduling

### Provider Adapter Contract
- Provider adapters should implement:
  - `chat`
  - `stream_chat`
  - `models`
  - `tool_call_schema`
  - `auth_status`
- Providers:
  - `local`
  - `anthropic`
  - `openai`
- The chat planner should use the same tool schema no matter which provider is active.

### Model Registry
- Model recipes should map:
  - canonical model id
  - aliases such as `qwen3.5`
  - engine preferences
  - supported quantizations
  - minimum memory and VRAM expectations
  - required flags or parser settings
  - preferred endpoint settings
  - known unsupported combinations
- The registry should support:
  - family aliases
  - size variants
  - CPU fallback suggestions
  - provider fallback suggestions

### Request Resolution Flow
- For a prompt like `serve Qwen3.5 with vllm`, the resolver should:
  1. parse action intent
  2. normalize model alias
  3. detect available engines and hardware
  4. check whether the requested combo is feasible
  5. produce a concrete plan
  6. ask for approval if changes are needed
  7. execute tools and stream results
- The resolver should not rely entirely on an LLM.
- Use a hybrid approach:
  - grammar and alias-based parsing for known actions
  - optional LLM planner for ambiguity resolution
  - final execution only from structured tool calls

## Automations and Watchers

### Design Goals
- Let `rocm-cli` observe state and react to events in a controlled way.
- Keep autonomy narrow, auditable, and revocable.
- Use structured tools, not arbitrary shell.

### Event Sources
- scheduler and cron-like timers
- managed service lifecycle events
- update checks
- health checks
- GPU metrics when available
- model endpoint health
- local webhook triggers

### Policy Levels
- `observe`
  - detect and notify only
- `propose`
  - build a plan and queue it for review in the TUI
- `contained`
  - auto-run only allowlisted low-risk actions inside the sandbox

### Examples
- `therock-update`
  - check for a newer release or nightly and notify
- `server-recover`
  - if a managed model server crashes, collect logs and restart it
- `gpu-thermal-protect`
  - if temperature or memory pressure is too high, stop or reduce serving load
- `cache-warm`
  - prefetch model weights or engine artifacts during idle periods

### Sandbox Design
- V1 Linux sandbox should use a rootless isolation tool such as `bubblewrap`.
- Worker constraints:
  - read-only root filesystem where possible
  - private temp and work directories
  - no arbitrary home directory access
  - no network unless the watcher explicitly needs it
  - no GPU device access unless required
  - process, CPU, RAM, and wall-clock limits
- Sandboxed jobs should not receive raw shell access.
- They should invoke a restricted internal tool API such as:
  - `check_updates`
  - `doctor_snapshot`
  - `list_servers`
  - `restart_server`
  - `stop_server`
  - `prefetch_artifact`
  - `notify_user`

### Watcher Config Shape

```toml
[automation]
enabled = true
default_mode = "propose"

[[watchers]]
id = "therock-update"
on = "schedule:0 */6 * * *"
then = ["check_updates", "notify_if_newer"]
mode = "observe"

[[watchers]]
id = "server-recover"
on = "event:server.crashed"
then = ["collect_logs", "restart_server", "healthcheck"]
mode = "contained"

[[watchers]]
id = "driver-upgrade"
on = "event:update.available"
if = "component == 'driver'"
then = ["prepare_install_plan"]
mode = "propose"
```

### TUI Integration
- The TUI should expose an `Automations` view that shows:
  - active watchers
  - last event time
  - current policy
  - last outcome
  - queued proposals
  - audit history

## Security and Trust Model
- Separate read-only inspection from mutating actions.
- Require user approval for anything privileged or disruptive.
- Keep automation actions capability-scoped.
- Keep watcher execution in a sandbox with a narrow API.
- Keep secrets out of plugins unless explicitly granted.
- Store provider keys in OS keychain facilities when available, with file-based encrypted fallback if needed.
- Maintain an audit log for:
  - install actions
  - update actions
  - watcher-triggered actions
  - provider usage
  - service lifecycle changes

- Test against supported Linux GPU families, supported Windows GPU families, and CPU-only fallback hosts.
- Exit criteria:
  - bootstrap install, runtime install, serving, update, and watcher flows are stable
  - release process can ship signed CLI and metadata updates

## MVP Definition
- `rocm` launches a TUI on Linux and Windows.
- `rocm doctor` detects host and runtime state.
- `rocm install sdk --channel release|nightly` installs a managed TheRock runtime.
- `rocm update` prompts for newer CLI/runtime versions.
- `rocm serve` can launch:
  - `pytorch` using TheRock PyTorch wheels on Windows
  - `llama.cpp` on CPU on Linux and as a fallback on Windows
  - `vllm` on ROCm GPU on Linux
- `rocm` chat mode can use:
  - `local`
  - `anthropic`
  - `openai`
- `rocm automations` supports at least:
  - update notifications
  - managed server crash recovery

## Open Questions
- How much model metadata should live in TheRock-owned release assets versus a `rocm-cli` metadata index?
- What is the minimum supported Linux distro matrix for driver install support?
- What are the exact rules for switching between a managed `pip` venv runtime and a tarball-installed system prefix on the same machine?
- Should remote provider chat be enabled by explicit opt-in on first use, even when API keys are already present in the environment?

## Recommended Immediate Next Steps
- Confirm the V1 host support policy:
  - Linux and Windows
  - CPU-only fallback
  - macOS deferred
- Confirm the exact activation model for `pip` venv runtimes versus tarball system installs.
- Confirm whether `rocm-cli` should live in its own repository or inside a TheRock-adjacent org repo.
- After that, write:
  - command and config spec
  - plugin protocol spec
  - metadata/index schema
  - TUI interaction spec
